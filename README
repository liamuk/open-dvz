Instructions:

	- First download craftbukkit and the necessary mods:
		- Essentials
		- MobDisguise
		- MagicSpells
		- bPermissions
	- Replace the stock files with the provided files
	- Run craftbukkit.sh to start the server and the game
		- make an admin dragon-warrior from the console:
		world worlds/main/main
		user <username>
		user setgroup dragon-warrior
		- have them fly above spawn and drop magma creams in the beginning
		gamemode <username> 1
		give <username> magmacream 64
		- make them a normal user again
		gamemode <username> 0
		user setgroup default
		kill <username>
		- PLAY!
		- When the time comes, turn an admin into a dragon
		give <username> 2266		
		- and have them use /fly to fly
		- PLAY!
	- Stop the server and use reset.sh to reset permissions and the world for
	 the next round 


Some caveats:

	- There are massive problems with permissions right now (this is probably
	why rurikar and the gang didn't release their version) so this is
	really only suitable for playing with trustworthy friends right now	
	- There is only one unremarkable map provided
	- The classes are probably not properly implemented, because I only 
	watched the youtube videos, and never actually played the game
	- Only 4 mobs are implemented at this time- zombie, skeleton, creeper,
	 spider
